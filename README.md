# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

--OVERVIEW--

The point of this challenge was to take information from multiple sources about a companies employee database and make inferences based on this information. We were given multiple files containing employees information and wanted to filter and sift through this to find the number of employees that will be retiring in each staff category or titles. We created sql queries to find this information then counted the number of employees that will be retiring for each employee title (senior staff, engineer, technique leader etc.). We then searched this information again to find the number of people who are eligible for a mentorship prgram or those retiring employees who were born in 1965 by creating another query for this information. We added this information into seperate tables and exported them into seperate csv files for easier reading and application. 

--RESULTS--

-One thing to take away from this analysis in deliverable 1 is just how many people are in the retiring group. We did a count of the total number of employees for each position title. 

-Another thing that we made sure of was to filter out any employees that are not still in the company, so our new list and table only contains those that are working employees

-We found a list of employees that fit the requirement for a mentorship program being born during a certain time frame. 

-we created and put all of thes tables together using csv files for easier readability and compiling of the new data we found

--SUMMARY--

One more thing i would have added is an overview of the finances that each employee might bring into the company, unerstanding how replacing a newly retired employee will affect the company in a positive or negative way. In this query I basically just summed the salaries of each type of employee to see how much each title was getting paid. I realized after I added this file that an average estimate of salary for each employee title may have been more useful in this analysis instead of sum. But an average salary of each employee title would be useful and possibly even making the list of retirees more descriptive and detailed for each year or each title instead of all 4 years.
