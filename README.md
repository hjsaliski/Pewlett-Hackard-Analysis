# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

--OVERVIEW--

The point of this challenge was to take information from multiple sources about a companies employee database and make inferences based on this information. We were given multiple files containing employees information and wanted to filter and sift through this to find the number of employees that will be retiring in each staff category or titles. We created sql queries to find this information then counted the number of employees that will be retiring for each employee title (senior staff, engineer, technique leader etc.). We then searched this information again to find the number of people who are eligible for a mentorship prgram or those retiring employees who were born in 1965 by creating another query for this information. We added this information into seperate tables and exported them into seperate csv files for easier reading and application.
